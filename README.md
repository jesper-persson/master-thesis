# Volume-Preserving Deformation of Terrain in Real-Time

This project is the result of my master's thesis in computer graphics. Here's an excerpt of the abstract:

*This thesis proposes an efficient system for permanent terrain deformations in real-time. In a volume-preserving manner, the ground material is displaced and animated as objects of arbitrary shapes intersect the terrain. Recent features of GPUs are taken advantage of to achieve high enough performance for the system to be used in real-time applications such as games and simulators.*
